            <li><h3>Kedarnath</h3>
                <p>Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of the field') is a Hindu temple roughly 1200 years old[1] dedicated to Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region. The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony, mule and manchan service is available to reach the temple. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by the Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.[3] The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.[4][3] The temple is one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas and is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[5] It is one of the 275 paadal petra sthalams expounded in the Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th centuries by 63 saints called Nayanars. This temple is sung of by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar, Sundarar and Sekkizhar in their Tevaram texts.</p>

            <li><h3> Jagannath Puri</h3>
                <p>The Jagannath Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath, a form of Vishnu - one of the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism, Puri is in the state of Odisha on the eastern coast of India. The present temple was rebuilt from the tenth century onwards, on the site of pre existing temples in the compound but not the main Jagannatha temple, and begun by Anantavarman Chodaganga, the first king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra,[2] or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath (which gave its name to the English term 'juggernaut') is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every twelve or 19 years by an exact replica.[3] It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.</p>

                <p>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territory of India consisting of 572 islands, of which 37 are inhabited, at the junction of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea.[6] The territory is about 150 km (93 mi) north of Aceh in Indonesia and separated from Thailand and Myanmar by the Andaman Sea. It comprises two island groups, the Andaman Islands (partly) and the Nicobar Islands, separated by the 150 km (100 mile) wide Ten Degree Channel (on the 10°N parallel), with the Andaman islands to the north of this latitude, and the Nicobar islands to the south (or by 179 km; 111 miles). The Andaman Sea lies to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west. The island chains are thought to be a submerged extension of the Arakan Mountains. The territory's capital is the city of Port Blair. The total land area of the islands is approximately 8,249 km2 (3,185 sq mi). The territory is divided into three districts: the Nicobar District with Car Nicobar as its capital, the South Andaman district with Port Blair as its capital, and the North and Middle Andaman district with Mayabunder as its capital. The islands host the Andaman and Nicobar Command, the only tri-service geographical command of the Indian Armed Forces.</p>

        <img width="400" src="https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/pictures/5/20396825/e8946f85b09372e7797404ad6baa6e5f.jpg?fit=around|771.75:416.25&crop=771.75:416.25;*,*" alt="Litti Chokha Image">
        <h3>Litti Chokha</h3>
        <p>Litti is the stuffed whole wheat dough ball and Chokha is a mashed relish that is served with litti. Chokha can be made with roasted eggplant (baingan), boiled or roasted potatoes (aloo) and roasted tomatoes (tamatar). You can make them separately or even combine all three and make one chokha. You can even combine the baingan and tomatoes and make one chokha and make a second one with potatoes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Litti</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preparing dough cover
                        <ol>
                            <li>In a mixing bowl, take 2 cups whole wheat flour/atta (240 grams) and ¼ teaspoon salt. Also add 1 tablespoon ghee or oil.</li>
                            <li> Now add water in parts and knead to a smooth soft dough. I added ¾ cup water. Depending on the quality of flour, you can add ¾ to 1 cup water.</li>
                            <li>Knead till smooth and soft. Cover the dough and keep aside.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>Preparing stuffing for litti
                        <ol>
                            <li>In a mortar-pestle take ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and ½ teaspoon saunf (fennel seeds). lightly crush them and keep aside. Take 1 cup sattu/roasted gram flour in a mixing bowl or pan.</li>
                            <li>Add the slightly crushed cumin seeds and fennel seeds. Now add ½ teaspoon ajwain, ½ teaspoon nigella seeds and ½ teaspoon red chilli powder.</li>
                            <li> Next add 1 to 2 teaspoons chopped green chilies, 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger and 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic. Add 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves and ¼ teaspoon black salt. Also add regular salt as per taste.</li>
                            <li>Next add 2 teaspoons mustard oil. Next add 2 teaspoons mustard oil. Mix very well.</li>
                            <li>Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons water all over and mix the flour with water evenly. Do add more water if required. The sattu stuffing mixture should not be too dry or too wet. If the mixture is dry, then the dryness is felt when eating littis.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>Stuffing and making litti
                        <ol>
                            <li>After 30 minutes, now make small or medium sized balls from the dough.</li>
                            <li>First method – sprinkling little flour, roll each dough ball to a circle of about 5 to 6 inches. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing in the center. Pleat and then join the edges. press the joined part and lightly roll the stuffed dough balls in your palms, so as to get a round shape. Keep aside.</li>
                            <li>Second method – is to flatten the dough ball with your palms and make a shallow cup. Now place the stuffing. Gently bring together the outer dough cover in the center, while pressing the stuffing. Join and then seal the edges. This is a bit tricky method. So please use the method which suits you. I have mentioned two ways of stuffing the littis. Here is the prepared litti with the second method. Keep the prepared littis under a cotton towel or napkin, so that the dough does not dry out.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>Baking litti</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prepare all stuffed littis this way and place them on a baking tray, which has been greased with some oil. Do grease baking tray well, otherwise the littis can stuck to the tray. Place the littis in a preheated oven at 200 degrees celsius. Preheat the oven for 20 minutes prior to baking at 200 degrees celsius.</li>
                        <li>After 10 to 15 minutes of baking, remove the tray and flip each litti. keep the tray back in the oven. Again after 10 to 15 minutes, remove the baking tray and flip each litti. Place the tray back in the oven. You will have to do this once or twice more for even baking.</li>
                        <li> Bake till the crust looks done with some light brown or golden brown spots on them. Timing will vary upon the size and litres of oven. It took me about 45 minutes for these to bake. Brush them with some melted ghee all over.</li>
                        <li>This step is optional and only to get charred spots on the litti. Secure the litti in a pair of tongs and place it on fire. Rotate for a few seconds till you see some charred spots on littis.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chokha</strong>
                <p>Wash brinjals and tomatoes then fry them. Allow them to cool, peel the skins, keep them in a bowl and mash with a spoon. Put the chopped spices, salt, oil and mix properly. Brinjal Chokha is ready. 
                    If you prefe garlic and onion then peel 5-6 cloves of garlic then finely chop them. Peel 1 onion, chop it finely and mix these with brinjal.</p>
